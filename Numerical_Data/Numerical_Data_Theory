What is Numerical Data?
	Numerical Data is a data type expressed in numbers,rather than natural language description. It is also called as Qunatitative data.Numerical data differentiates itself from other number form data types with its ability to carry out arithmetic operations with these numbers.

What are the Types of Numerical Data?
	1.Discrete data
	2.Continous data
	    i)interval data
	    ii) ratio data
	    
1.Dicrete Data
	Discrete Data represents countable items and can take both numerical and categorical forms, depending on usage.Possible of count(finite memebers)
	
2.Continuous data
	Continuous data represents measurements - their values are described as intervals on a number line, rather than take counting numbers.impossible to count(but uncountably finite)
	
  Interval Data
  	This is a data type measured along a scale, in which each point is placed at an equal distance from one another.Interval data takes numerical values that can only take the addition and subtraction operations.
  	
  Ratio Data
  	Ratio data is a continuous data type similar to interval data but has a zero point. In other words, ratio data is interval data wtih zero points.
 
Examples of Numerical Data
		1.Census   			--  Countably finite discrete data
		2.Temperature			--  Continuous Interval data
		3.Age 				--  finite dicrete data
		4.Mark Grading			--  continuous data
		5.Annual income		--  finite discrete data	
		6.Time 			--  Continuous data
		7.Height			--  Continuous data
		8.IQ Test			--  Continuous data 
		9.Weight			--  Continuous data
		10.CGPA 			--  discrete data
		11.The no of children   	--  discrete data
		12The no of student 		--  discrete data
		13.Result of Rolling a dice 	--  discrete data
  		14.Length of a person		--  continous data
